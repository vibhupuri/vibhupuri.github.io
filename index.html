<h2><span>&raquo;About</span></h2>
<p>This is an experiment built by <a href="http://syndicatefx.com" target="_blank">Paulo Nunes</a> for showcasing a user profile or cv in an unusual but original way by simulating a command line interface. It's nothing more than the usual hidden elements triggered by some jQuery to show/hide each section of content, based on input values.</p>
<p>It makes use of <a href="https://github.com/gr8pathik/jquery-texttyper" target="_blank">jQuery-texttyper</a> for the fancy letter animations.</p>

<h2><span>&raquo;Usage</span></h2>
	<a href="www.google.com">hyperlinktest</a>
<p>Using it is pretty straight forward. Create several(as much as you need) divs or &laquo;section&raquo; elements each with it's unique id to hold your content. Make sure to have an error section (id="error") with some information to warn the user when he/she mistypes a command or if there is no section with that name, think of it as a 404 page.</p>
<p>A section with id="help" is also required so you can list all the available sections and let your users know what words to write to access that particular content.</p>
<p>The input field must be a standalone element and must not be placed inside any of the content divs or sections, and make sure you give it a classname "command", if you want to name it anything else you need to edit the app.js and change all instances of .command in the script to match your chosen classname.</p>
<p>In short, just view the source code of this demo, copy/modify it to your liking making sure you include the error and help sections.</p>
